				<p>There are many variations of passages of Lorem Ipsum available,
					but the majority have suffered alteration in some form, by injected humour, 
					or randomised words which don't look even slightly believable.
					If you are going to use a passage of Lorem Ipsum, you need to be
					sure there isn't anything embarrassing hidden in the middle of text.
					All the Lorem Ipsum generators on the Internet tend to repeat predefined 
					chunks as necessary, making this the first true generator on the Internet.
					It uses a dictionary of over 200 Latin words, combined with a handful of 
					model sentence structures, to generate Lorem Ipsum which looks reasonable
					. The generated Lorem Ipsum is therefore always free from repetition, injected 
					humour, or non-characteristic words etc.
					<br><br>
					Where does it come from?

					Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of
					classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock,
				 	a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, 
					consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature,
					discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum
					et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory
					of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..",
					comes from a line in section 1.10.32.
